link : [https://github.com/mhmiripoor/blogclub.git]
for name assents (image and fonts) in there we beater to use this. before run this ypu should add in assets. than use this!
this is the fact why we use this:
- less mistake: 
- change name is to harder than `Img.assets`
- how much we use some picture 

we develop img like this
```Assets.img.icons.notification.image(),```   
when you change path, you should be run this commend in terminal for change file name
`dart run build_runner build`
We Can use svg like this:
`Assets.img.icons.logo.svg(width: 32, height: 32),`
